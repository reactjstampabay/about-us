## Code of Conduct

ReactJS Tampa Bay is dedicated to providing a comfortable environment in which to mentor each other and spread awareness of new concepts & projects related to the React community & ecosystem. In order to maintain this environment all persons are free to speak without fear of interruptions or ridicule. Each of our meetups is intended to provide a harassment-free experience for everyone involved, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). Racism, sexism, sexual harassment, etc. are not acceptable at any of our meetups nor through any online interaction with our members on Slack or elsewhere. We do not tolerate harassment of participants/attendees in any form. Attendees violating these rules will receive a warning regarding their inappropriate behavior and may be banned from all future meetups at the discretion of the organizers if this behavior continues. This is meant to be a safe, positive space for sharing knowledge and inspiring creativity. Be kind to your fellow members.
